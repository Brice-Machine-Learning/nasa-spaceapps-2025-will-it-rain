# Backend Development Diary – NASA POWER Integration
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Author:** Brice Nelson  
**Role:** Backend & Infrastructure Lead  
**Project:** NASA Space Apps 2025 – “Will It Rain?”

## Overview

On October 10, 2025, Brice Nelson advanced the backend data infrastructure for the *“Will It Rain?”* project by implementing, debugging, and validating the **NASA POWER dataset retrieval service**. The objective was to ensure that the application could dynamically fetch, parse, and locally cache daily weather data from the NASA POWER API for specific latitude-longitude coordinates.

---

## Technical Progress

- Refined the `dataset_service.py` module within `src/services/` to handle **real-time data retrieval** from NASA’s POWER API, introducing logic to automatically manage yearly data chunks and cache combined results in `data/raw/`.
- Implemented a robust **CSV parsing function (`parse_nasa_csv`)** that dynamically detects and skips variable-length metadata headers using the `-END HEADER-` marker, replacing the earlier static `skiprows=10` approach. This ensures compatibility with all POWER dataset formats and prevents data misalignment.
- Updated the data directory logic to resolve paths dynamically via `get_data_dir()`, eliminating global path dependencies and improving portability across development and testing environments.
- Developed a new asynchronous **integration test (`tests/test_dataset_service.py`)** using `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`. The test validates:
  - Successful connection and response from the NASA POWER API.  
  - Correct CSV creation and caching.  
  - Expected DataFrame structure with key variables (`YEAR`, `T2M`, `RH2M`, etc.).
- Added a lightweight **manual verification script** (`scripts/manual_dataset_download.py`) to perform standalone dataset downloads and confirm CSV integrity through file previews and metadata reporting.
- Conducted end-to-end verification of the fetch-parse-cache workflow, ensuring data persistence within `data/raw/` and confirming that subsequent calls correctly detect and utilize cached files.

## Outcome

By the end of the session, the backend service demonstrated reliable NASA POWER data retrieval and parsing, with a validated caching mechanism and comprehensive test coverage.  
This work represents a critical milestone in connecting the backend API to live climate data sources, supporting the project’s predictive model integration in upcoming phases.

## Next Steps

- Integrate the dataset service into the `/dataset` API route for live endpoint testing.
- Begin preprocessing pipeline development to clean and standardize the retrieved weather variables.
- Prepare for ML model linkage and initial `/predict` route testing.
