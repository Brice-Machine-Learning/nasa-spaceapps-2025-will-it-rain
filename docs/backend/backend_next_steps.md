# 🔭 Backend Next Steps

## NASA Space Apps 2025 – *“Will It Rain?”*

---

## 🧩 Context

With the backend framework now established and all current endpoints passing tests, the next phase will focus on **data ingestion, preprocessing, and model integration**.  
These steps will transform the backend from a routing layer into a complete API pipeline that retrieves, prepares, and serves predictions for rainfall probability.

The work described below focuses **exclusively on backend development** — not UI or ML model training — but on the systems required to connect these components into a unified service.

## 🧱 Objectives

| Objective | Description | Owner | Success Criteria |
|------------|--------------|--------|------------------|
| **1. Implement NASA/NOAA Dataset Retrieval (`/dataset/{lat}/{lon}`)** | Build an endpoint that takes geographic coordinates and retrieves raw weather/climate data from a NASA or NOAA API (e.g., POWER or GHCN). Data should be stored temporarily as a `.csv` or in-memory object for further processing. | Brice | ✅ Successful API call returning valid weather data for given coordinates.<br>✅ Handles missing data and network errors gracefully. |
| **2. Build Preprocessing Service (`/preprocess`)** | Develop a dedicated service to clean, normalize, and prepare the fetched dataset for model input. This includes handling null values, filtering relevant features, and encoding date/time fields. | Brice (with support from Ainesh for feature mapping) | ✅ Cleaned dataset schema matches model input.<br>✅ Endpoint returns processed sample output (schema validation passes). |
| **3. Integrate Prediction Endpoint (`/predict`)** | Connect the backend to the trained ML model. The endpoint will accept `{location, date}` and return a rainfall probability and confidence score. The model will be accessed through the integration branch, provided by Ainesh. | Brice & Ainesh | ✅ Response includes `rain_probability` and `confidence`.<br>✅ End-to-end flow from `/location` → `/dataset` → `/preprocess` → `/predict` completes successfully. |
| **4. Add Redis-Based Caching (Optional)** | Replace in-memory `lru_cache` with Redis for persistent caching across sessions. This will speed up repeated location lookups and reduce API request costs. | Brice | ✅ Redis container configured and accessible locally.<br>✅ Cache hit rate >50% on repeated requests. |
| **5. Implement Logging & Error Monitoring** | Add structured logging (FastAPI middleware or `logging` module) and error tracking for debugging and API reliability during demo. | Brice | ✅ Logs contain timestamped request/response summaries.<br>✅ 4xx/5xx errors automatically captured. |
| **6. Containerize Backend for Deployment** | Create a Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration for the backend service, ensuring consistent local and demo deployment. | Brice | ✅ `docker-compose up` successfully builds and runs the backend locally.<br>✅ Accessible at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. |
| **7. Documentation & API Reference (Swagger + README)** | Expand project documentation to describe all routes, schemas, and example payloads. Ensure `/docs` and `/redoc` endpoints show accurate OpenAPI metadata. | Brice | ✅ API docs auto-generate successfully.<br>✅ README includes quickstart and endpoint overview. |

## 🧠 Development Sequence

### **Phase 1 — Data Access**

1. Finalize NASA/NOAA API integration  
2. Test dataset retrieval for multiple coordinates  
3. Add caching and retry logic for stability  

### **Phase 2 — Preprocessing & Validation**

1. Transform raw data into standardized schema  
2. Validate against model feature expectations  
3. Build tests for dataset integrity  

### **Phase 3 — Model Integration**

1. Integrate serialized ML model (joblib or ONNX)  
2. Add `/predict` route and confirm full API chain  
3. Conduct final end-to-end test suite  

### **Phase 4 — Deployment Readiness**

1. Add Dockerfile, health checks, and `.env` templates  
2. Run final CI tests  
3. Prepare demo-ready environment for hackathon presentation

## 💡 Summary

The backend is now in an ideal position for integration work.  
All core services (routing, location resolution, and caching) are operational and tested.  
The next phase will focus on **expanding functionality**, **connecting to real data sources**, and **delivering predictions through a stable, documented API**.

By completing these steps, the backend will achieve full feature parity with the project’s MVP goals — enabling users to input a city and date and receive a rainfall probability derived from NASA and NOAA datasets.
