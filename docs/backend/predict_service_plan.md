# üåßÔ∏è Predict Service Plan

## NASA Space Apps 2025 ‚Äì *‚ÄúWill It Rain?‚Äù*

## Component: Backend Model Inference Layer

---

## üß© Purpose

The **Predict Service** is the final stage of the backend pipeline.  
It receives a fully preprocessed dataset from the `/preprocess` service and uses the trained machine learning model to generate rainfall predictions for a specific location and date.

This layer transforms data into insight ‚Äî turning cleaned weather variables into interpretable, probability-based predictions.  

It will serve as the **core of the MVP**, delivering real-time rainfall likelihood for any given location.

---

## üß† Design Philosophy

- **Separation of Concerns** ‚Äì Keep model logic isolated from API routes.  
- **Transparency** ‚Äì Return both the predicted class (rain/no rain) and model confidence/probability.  
- **Efficiency** ‚Äì Load model once at startup (not per request) to minimize latency.  
- **Resilience** ‚Äì Handle missing data, invalid input, or model errors gracefully.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Overview

| Step | Description | Output |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **1. Input** | Receives a processed feature vector from `/preprocess` service or frontend payload. | Dictionary or Pandas DataFrame of features |
| **2. Model Loading** | Loads the trained rainfall prediction model (e.g., `.joblib`, `.pkl`, or `.onnx`). Cached in memory for reuse. | In-memory model object |
| **3. Prediction Execution** | Feeds the input features into the model‚Äôs `predict_proba()` or equivalent method. | Probability of rain (0‚Äì1 float) |
| **4. Confidence Scoring** | Extracts model confidence or uncertainty metrics (where supported). | Confidence float |
| **5. Output Formatting** | Returns standardized JSON output for the API route. | JSON response with probabilities and metadata |

## üß∞ Responsibilities

1. **Model Management**
   - Load the trained ML model (provided by Ainesh) at startup.
   - Support multiple serialization formats (`.joblib`, `.pkl`, `.onnx`).
   - Store model path in environment variable or settings file for flexibility.

2. **Prediction Pipeline**
   - Accept validated input from preprocessing step.
   - Convert data to numpy arrays or tensors (depending on model type).
   - Perform forward pass through model and extract probabilities.

3. **Result Packaging**
   - Convert numerical outputs into interpretable format (rain/no rain, confidence).
   - Include metadata such as timestamp, model version, and feature importance (if applicable).

4. **Error Handling**
   - Gracefully manage missing features or unexpected input schema.
   - Return structured error messages instead of stack traces.

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Keep the model in memory across requests.
   - Consider lightweight model variants if latency becomes a concern.

## üß© Integration Points

| Component | Interaction |
|------------|-------------|
| **`/preprocess` Service** | Supplies the cleaned and feature-engineered input DataFrame. |
| **`predict_service`** | Loads the model and generates prediction probabilities. |
| **`/predict` Route** | API endpoint that wraps the predict service and exposes the results to the frontend. |
| **Frontend/UI** | Displays rain probability, confidence, and feature summaries. |
| **Logs/Analytics** | Records prediction results for analysis or model retraining insights. |

## üß† Future Enhancements

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Model Versioning** | Tag predictions with model version number to track updates. | Improves reproducibility and auditability. |
| **Explainability (SHAP / LIME)** | Include feature contributions in API response for interpretability. | Helps explain why the model predicts rain. |
| **Batch Predictions** | Allow multiple date/location requests in a single call. | Efficient data exploration for researchers. |
| **Streaming Integration** | Adapt prediction pipeline for real-time or scheduled updates (e.g., hourly forecasts). | Enables continuous monitoring capabilities. |
| **Model Refresh Endpoint** | Add admin route to reload updated models dynamically without server restart. | Facilitates iterative model tuning during hackathon. |

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target |
|------------|---------|
| **Model Integration** | Model loads successfully and is callable via `/predict`. |
| **Prediction Accuracy** | Predictions align with expected outputs for test datasets. |
| **Latency** | Single prediction completes in < 500ms after preprocessing. |
| **Robustness** | Handles invalid or incomplete data gracefully. |
| **Response Clarity** | Returns structured JSON with rain probability and confidence. |

## üßæ Testing & Validation Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Mock model and verify correct input-output transformations.
   - Test invalid input handling and probability bounds (0‚Äì1).

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Run full pipeline test (`/location` ‚Üí `/dataset` ‚Üí `/preprocess` ‚Üí `/predict`).
   - Validate schema continuity and prediction format.

3. **Regression Tests**
   - Confirm consistent predictions after model updates.

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Benchmark prediction speed and memory usage under load.

## üí° Summary

The **Predict Service** transforms the backend from a data processing engine into a true **predictive intelligence system**.  
By connecting the preprocessed NASA data with the trained ML model, it enables the project‚Äôs core functionality ‚Äî predicting rainfall probability for any given location and date.

Once integrated, this service will complete the backend pipeline:
> `/location` ‚Üí `/dataset` ‚Üí `/preprocess` ‚Üí `/predict`

This marks the transition from infrastructure setup to full-feature MVP delivery for the hackathon presentation.
