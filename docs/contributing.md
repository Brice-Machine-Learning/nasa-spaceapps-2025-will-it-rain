# Contributing Guidelines â€“ NASA Space Apps 2025

Welcome to our team repo! ðŸš€  
This is a hackathon project, so our focus is **speed, collaboration, and keeping `main` stable**.  

---

## ðŸ”€ Branching Strategy

- **main** â†’ always stable & demo-ready. Do **not** commit directly.  
- **integration** â†’ used for daily merges and testing full pipeline.  
- **feature branches**:  
  - `backend-api` â†’ Brice (backend, infra, CI/CD)  
  - `data-model` â†’ Ainesh (data wrangling, EDA, ML model)  
  - optional: `ui-streamlit`, `docker-deploy` for stretch goals  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Workflow

1. **Create branch from `main`:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

2. **Push your branch:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add data preprocessing script"
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request (PR) â†’ `integration`:**
   - Title PR clearly (e.g., `feat: backend /predict endpoint`).
   - Keep PRs small and focused.  

4. **Daily merge into `integration`.**  
   - Once both sides work together (backend â†” model), we merge into `main`.

## âœ… Commit Message Convention

- `feat:` â†’ new feature (`feat: add rain probability model`)  
- `fix:` â†’ bug fix (`fix: API response schema`)  
- `chore:` â†’ cleanup / CI / docs (`chore: add requirements.txt`)  
- `docs:` â†’ documentation (`docs: add architecture.md draft`)  

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- Run tests locally before pushing:  

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

- CI will also run `ruff` (lint) and `pytest` on your branch.  

---

## ðŸ“– Notes

- Keep `docs/` updated (plan, resources, architecture, pitch).  
- Use `notebooks/` for exploration only â€” final code should go in `src/`.  
- Communication: Discord + GitHub PR comments.

ðŸ’¡ Remember: The goal is **a working MVP + clear presentation**, not perfection.
